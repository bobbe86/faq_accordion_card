### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked



## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This section took 3 tries until I finally started searching for "accordion menu" and found a great tutorial only using CSS and HTML. No javascript! I will always go back to this for accordion menuus.



### Continued development

For future projects I would like to learn how to control absolute positioned elements with responsive design. Im thinking, wrap them in a div box with relative postion,  then absolute position them to the box, and control the box placement? I would also like to make the transitions and animations smoother and not choppy
